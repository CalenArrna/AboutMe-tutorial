        Hi, my name is Csaba Nagy!
        \n\nTo be a programmer was a childhood dream, but did not have the right
        \noppurtunities in that time. But in the end of last year, I started to dig myself in the
        \ndeveloper role and I ended up in a course made by the Progmatic Coding Academy.
        \nAs I got deeper and deeper I realised I enjoy it more and more every day.
        \nI dropped in to a very fascinating universe.\n\n

    <string name="bio2">On the course the main programming language was Java. Later on we also learned HTML,
        \nCSS and SQL (MySQL, PostGresql). In our project work we used the Scrum Metodology and
        \nGit Version Control. In the last part I decided to go for the backend specialisation,
        \nso I had the luck to get know of the Bootstrap and Spring framework combined with REST API.
        \nOther technologies I worked with: JPA, Thymeleaf, Oauth, Maven, Bootstrap,
        \nDozer and Postman. I spent my free time to get some knowledge about other languages
        \nlike JavaScript, C#, Kotlin and Swift.\n\n</string>
